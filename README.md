## My process

    1) Plan & Structure: I started with an HTML structure, keeping in mind the modular BEM approach.
    2) Design & Aesthetics: CSS was used to enhance the look, with a focus on responsive and interactive elements.
    3) Interactivity: JavaScript was employed to add dynamic behavior, like adjusting the price according to user input.
    4) Testing & Iteration: Throughout the process, I tested the webpage in the browser, tweaked styles and scripts, and iterated to enhance user experience.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
